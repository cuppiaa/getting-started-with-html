    <h1>Stage 0 Notes</h1>

<b>Summary</b>
<p>This opening stage sets the stage (pun <em>intended</em>) for the rest of
  the course.  It gives a high-level overview of the internet (Part 1) and then jumps
  into basic HTML structure and commands (Part 2).
</p>
<b>Part 1</b> (a.k.a <em>How the Web Works</em>)
<br>
<br>Part 1 describes the major components of how the web works:
<br><b>You</b>:  Enter requests and receive information from the computer + browser
<br><b>Computer+Browser</b>:  Displays information
<br><b>Internet</b>:  Worlds largest network
<br><b>Servers</b>:  Holds (i.e. hosts) all the files
<p>The Internet connects to the various servers through a protocal called HTTP.  
  This <a href="https://youtu.be/kzyfIiVZPJA"> video here</a> gives a great
  overview.
</p>
<b>Part 2</b> (HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language)
<p>The web is mainly made up of HTML pages.  An HTML page has 4 main components
  <br>1.  Text (what you see or 'content')
  <br>2.  Markup (what <b>it</b> looks <em>like</em>)
  <br>3.  References (images, videos)
  <br>4.  Links (other web pages)
</p>
<p>Part 2 mainly focuses on the second component of the HTML page.  
  <br> A <em>Tag</em> directs a specific action.  We learned the <em>b (bold), 
  br (break), a (anchor), em (emphasis), img (image), p (paragraph)
  </em>tags.  Some of these tags are "Inline" (e.g. <em>b, br</em>) and some are
  "Block" (e.g. <em>p</em>).  The main difference to know now is that "Block"
  tags essentially put an invisible box around the content.  
</p>
<p>An <em>Element</em> is the tag and the content that the tag surrounds</p>
<p>An <em>Attribute</em> is a property of the Element</p>
<p>Finally, we reviewed how a complete HTML document looks 
(Doc Type, Opening HTML Tag, Header/Meta Data, Body/Content, Closing HTML tag).

<b>Key Items to Remember:</b>
<br>DON'T TRY TO REMEMBER ALL THIS STUFF
<br>If you don't close your tag (and it's not a Void Tag), then the tag goes 
on forever.  It's <b><em>best practice</em></b> to create your closing tag when
you create your opening tag
<br>Computers are literal.  This causes them to be "dumb".
